# How to generate the code

A lot of the code in this repo is generated by using this command:

```
openapi-generator generate -g typescript-fetch -i https://api.confidentify.com/openapi?format=yaml
```

However, the results aren't exactly perfect. So we apply some post-generation patches. Maybe the `openapi-generator` tool will improve enough to make that redundant. For now, run the command and inspect the diff carefully.
